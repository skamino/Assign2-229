    <h3>A bit about me.</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here at Centennial College I like to enjoy school as opposed to see it as a burden.  
    The classes and work are just another day.  In my spare time, which I have more of since the pandemic, 
    I have taken up the violin, which has become a fun hobby.  I still do a lot of coding and love it like it 
    was by brother.  Thanks for reading.
